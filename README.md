# 🌑 Project Genesis: The First Living DNA Code
This project is not a software. It is a biological insurrection.
Using a self-developed GVM (Genesis Virtual Machine) and Darwinian evolutionary loops, I have successfully evolved a digital organism that:
Performs Arithmetic: It evolved addition logic from pure noise.
Self-Heals: It repairs its own binary structure upon corruption.
Shows Resistance: It survived the 10MB Battle Royale against 100 predatory codes.
Final Form: Compiled into a 140bp DNA sequence.
