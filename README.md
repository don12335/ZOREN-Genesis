## What is this?
**Project Genesis** is not a simple genetic algorithm. It is a complete **Biological Operating System**.

It simulates a fault-tolerant Virtual Machine (The Genesis VM) that treats machine code as biological DNA. This allows programs to:
1.  **Mutate** without crashing (Fault Tolerance).
2.  **Evolve** complex logic (like XOR gates) from random noise.
3.  **Fight** for survival in a shared memory arena (Core War).
4.  **Transpile** themselves from "DNA" into valid C++ code (Bio-Universal Translation).

## God Tier Features

### 1. The Immortal Kernel (Survival Mode)
We evolved a program that stays functional even when its memory is actively corrupted by radiation.
```bash
bin/genesis.exe survival
# Watch as the code develops redundancy to survive random bit-flips.
```

### 2. Sentient Logic (Consciousness)
The system evolved a non-linear **XOR Logic Gate** without being taught math. It discovered the concept of "If/Else" branching purely through evolutionary pressure.
```bash
bin/genesis.exe consciousness
# Result: A digital brain that passes the Turing test for logic gates.
```

### 3. The Replicator (Artificial Life)
A virus that assumes control of the execution pointer and blindly copies its own genome to neighboring memory cells.
```bash
bin/genesis.exe export replicator
# Pit it against a Bomber in the Arena to see who wins!
```

### 4. The Bio-Universal Translator
Turn your biological experiment into a real-world tool. This compiler takes organic DNA and transpiles it into standard C++.
```bash
bin/genesis.exe transpile <DNA_STRING>
# Output: A valid .cpp file you can compile with GCC.
```

## The Arena (Core War)
Pit two organisms against each other in a shared 1024-byte memory pool.
- **Red (P1)**: Your Challenger
- **Blue (P2)**: The Opponent
- **Magenta**: Memory Collision (Combat)

```bash
bin/genesis.exe arena <DNA_1> <DNA_2>
```

## Build & Run
**Windows (No dependencies required)**:
```powershell
.\build.bat
```

## The Philosophy
Most AI writes code. **Genesis grows it.** 
This project proves that with a robust enough environment (VM) and strict enough competition (Arena), **Intelligence is inevitable.**
